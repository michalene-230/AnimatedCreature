    <p>
      I decided to create an alien in a planet environment for my animated creature project. The alien design was inspired by the "typical green alien" look that comes to our minds when we think of an alien. The planet has a purple backround with colorful mountains. There is another planet in the sky with other smaller planets/stars that are moving. The ground has small craters to give a more realistic ground look.
